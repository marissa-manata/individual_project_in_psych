# Sports Psychology Website
## PSY 481 - Individual Project in Psychology
### January 2021-December 2021

#### About
This project was sanctioned by my professor for his sports psychology research group. 

The website included the members of the research group and information about them, including some of their papers, the research groups' mission statement, the research groups' works, the research groups' research topics, the research groups' resources, and the groups' current projects.

The website was made to be easy for someone with little to no programming experience to be able to update it easily and to be hosted on a HostGator server.

This just includes the source code, not the Angular packages.

#### Languages and Frameworks used
- AngularJS

#### Update as of: January 8, 2023
I plan to update the website to use AngularJS, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.
